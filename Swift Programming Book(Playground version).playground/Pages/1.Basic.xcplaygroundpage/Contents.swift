//:# ‚≠ê Error Handling
//: to respond to error conditions during execution

//: function‚Äôs caller catch error and respond appropriately
func canThrowAnError() throws { /* function may or may not throw an error */}
//: function can throw error by including throws keyword
//: When call function that can throw error, you prepend try keyword to expression
//: Swift propagates errors out of their current scope until they are handled by catch clause
do { try canThrowAnError() /*no error was thrown*/ } catch { /*error was thrown*/ }
//: "do" creates new containing scope, which allows errors to be propagated to one or more catch clause

//: makeASandwich() throw error if no clean dishes are available or if any ingredients are missing
//: Because makeASandwich() throws, function call is wrapped in try expression
//: By wrapping function call in "do", any errors that are thrown will be propagated to provided catch clauses
//: If no error is thrown, eatASandwich() function is called
//: If error is thrown and match Error.OutOfCleanDishes, washDishes() will called
//: If error is thrown and match Error.MissingIngredientse, buyGroceries(_:) called with associated [String] value captured by catch pattern


//:# Assertions
//: If not possible to continue execution if particular condition not satisfied
//: trigger assertion to end code execution and provide opportunity to debug cause of absent or invalid value

//:# Debugging with Assertions
//: assertion is runtime check that logical condition definitely evaluates to true
//: Literally put, assertion ‚Äúasserts‚Äù that condition is true
//: Use assertion to make sure that essential condition is satisfied before executing any further code
//: If condition true, execution continues
//: If condition false, execution ends, and app terminated
//: If code trigger assertion while running in debug environment, see where invalid state occurred and query state of app at time that assertion was triggered
//: assertion provide suitable debug message as to nature of assert

let age = 3  //Change to -3
assert(age >= 0, "A person's age cannot be less than zero") // assertion triggered, age not >= 0
//: execution continue only if age >= 0 evaluate true
//: If value of age is negative, age >= 0 evaluates to false, and assertion is triggered, terminating application
//: assertion message can be omitted if desired, as in following example
assert(age >= 0)
//: Assertions are disabled when code is compiled with optimizations

//:# When Use Assertions
//: condition has potential to be false, but must definitely be true in order for continue execution
//: Suitable scenarios for assertion check include :
//: integer subscript index passed to custom subscript implementation, but subscript index value be too low or too high
//: value passed to function, but invalid value means that function cannot fulfill its task
//: optional value currently nil, but non-nil value is essential for subsequent code to execute successfully
